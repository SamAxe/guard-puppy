  work on KDE3 too. (Thanks to Carsten Pfeiffer)

  program after reseting the network subsystem.

  patch).
- Added "Log Aborted TCP connections" option. This can detect half-open
  stealth scans. (Now every nmap scan type can be logged).
- Specifies the log level to iptables as a number. (iptables>=1.2.3 wants a
  number)
- Scripts now explictly use bash instead of just plain sh. (bash is the
  official standard linux shell anyway).
- Fixed NFS support.
- Scripts now explicitly use gawk(1) instead of just plain awk(1).
- Fixed a problem that would stop the firewall script from working properly
  for people who use a language setting other than English. (thanks to
  Ludovic Lange detecting submitting a patch for this).

* September 28th 2001 Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>

- 1.9.6 release.
- Fixed a bug that would cause Guarddog to crash if you pressed ctrl+u while
  editing an address.
- Removed use of ++ in the firewall script.
- Added the netbios port 138 stuff to the DB and rolled all the netbios
  entries into just one entry: Windows Networking.
- Renamed "Authentication" in the DB to the more accurate "ident/auth".

  wide open.

- Now handles NIC broadcast addresses properly.
- Added code to enforce the Strong ES model (RFC 1122 section 3.3.4.2).
- Now correctly avoids trying to use DNS when there are no decent NICs
  available. (This was causing slow reboots with iptables complaining when
  it could not resolve host names).
- Added the ability to Import/Export the firewall script to the Advanced tab.
  It also has a "Description" text box for the benefit of people who want to
  juggle firewalls for several machines.
- Since adding Import/Export of firewall scripts, it has become meaningful to
  run Guarddog as a non-root user to create scripts to be used elsewhere.
  It is now possible to run Guarddog as a mere mortal with reduced
  functionality.
- Reformatted the changelog.

* August 12th 2001 Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>

- 1.9.4 release.
- No long uses the konsole to run the firewall script in. Guarddog now has
  it's own window that it can run the firewall and other scripts in.

  firewall if it doesn't contain at least one user defined zone.

  current zone should be connected to.

  icons and symbolic hints in places.

  about a given protocol.
- Also replaced a lot of input boxes in the GUI with spinboxes.

* June 14th 2001 Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>

- 1.9.2 release.
- Netfilter/iptables is now supported. The generated firewalls
  use either ipchains or iptables automatically at run time. It also uses
  iptables state tracking modules to handle annoying things like FTP. This
  provides a *much* tighter firewall than old ipchains.
- Advanced logging also part of the new iptables support, including rate
  limited logging and even log messages to warn when rate limiting is in
  effect. Reflected in the GUI is a whole new tab pane dedicated to logging.
- The address lists now happily accept domain names instead of just IP
  addresses.
- Also fixed a nasty bug in the ipchains firewall that was causing the wrong
  zone policies to be applied to packets. We don't call these a development
  versions for nothing folks!

* May 9th 2001 Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>

- 1.9.1 release.
- Protocols can now be set to either Deny/Accept and now also Reject.

  specific ports.

  database.

* April 14th 2001 Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>

- 1.9.0 release.
- The first developer release aiming at version 2.0. The 1.9.0 and higher
  code is a rewrite and redesign.  Significant changes are the use of XML
  to store a database of information about network protocols. The work
  and code is also shared with Watchdog. I intend to fully document the XML
  format I've designed in the hope that others will find it useful and
  support it.
- Guarddog now has the concept of 'zones' which allow you to place different
  hosts and networks into groups which can then have different firewall
  policies.
- Router configurations are a target for 2.0, but this development version
  still doesn't support them, yet.

  connections).

  Redhat).
