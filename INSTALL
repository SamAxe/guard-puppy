Currently the install process is less than streamlined.
Before compilation is possible it is nessicary to install
qt4-devel so that all the qt4 dependancies are on the system.

Boost version 1.49 (or higher?) is also necessary.
Because the current makefile is less than super smart it will
also be necessary to make sure that the boost shared objects are in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Assuming everything is on the system building should be fairly smooth.
$cd ~/PATH/TO/guard-puppy"
$qmake-qt4                                          'if this doesn't work install qt4
$make                                               
$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="PATH/TO/SHAREDLIBS"        'This is needed if guard-puppy complains about libboost_regex.so
$sudo ./guard-puppy                                 'to get full functionality root/sudo is needed
