Bugs:

* Use a 'splitter' in the GUI.?
  
Todo:

* Expand the protocol database. Need: mSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Interbase, MSSQL,
  Solid, DB2, Time Server, Hot Line, FreeNet.  Heaps more games.
  
Wishlist:

* Make it possible to disable the "You are about to stuff around with your
  networking..." warning message that pops up when you Apply the firewall.

* Rate limited other stuff. (iptables)

* Turn off logging of block packets on a protocol by protocol basis.

* Make it possible to execute an external user supplied script each time
  after the firewall is setup.

* More operating systems.

* Allow remote configuration of a firewall via SSH. (i.e. Guarddog uses
  SSH to copy, modify and run the firewall on the remote machine).

Test Cases:

* Spoofed packet with source address matching the address of targetted computer NIC.

+++ Add rtsp
+++ NFS sucks.
+++ Output the rules in rc.firewall in a consistent (non-random) order.
